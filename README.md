# Aim of the project: 
This project will  help us understand  individual experiences  in online learning based on academic background. We want to show that students are not equally prepared for online courses and this can result in increased amounts of academic stress.


The methods we are applying are anonymous online surveys. Afterwards, we will sample to obtain a typology of participants based on academic background. These results will allow us to make correlations and comparisons between people with a digital background (academic)  and those without.
